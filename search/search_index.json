Project management Setup tools I am using Fedora Linux workstation so many of needed tools were easily available from the distribution package management. Also I have used many of the needed tools earlier so those were already installed. Git sudo dnf install git Tool was already installed. I have used it a lot. Here is some basic commands I use most often: git status git log git show git diff git reset --hard git add <filename> git commit -s git push origin master Status shows general state of your current tree, like edited or new files. Log shows your commit history. Show shows last commit on your tree. Diff shows uncommitted changes what you have made your files. Reset --hard is handy when you have made changes to tree, but you need to discard those for some reason. Add adds file or directory you have edited to your commit you are going to do. Commit does the commit itself. Push uploads your local working tree to GitHub on my chase. GitHub https://github.com/ GitHub was already in use and configured. No need to to anything special. I decided to use it instead of GitLab due to that reason. For GitHub you need account. After that you need to add your public ssh key to GitHub in order to access using git-command. GitHub Pages https://github.com/ Used to host this WWW-site. It is easy to maintain that document just by pulling tree to GitHub using Git. Pages needed to be enabled from GitHub settings. Following settings are needed to GitHub Pages to point out location it loads that WWW-site. MkDocs sudo dnf install mkdocs-material First I thought I will maintain static HTML pages by hand. After I looked some videos, recommended MkDocs starts feeling more handy so I decided to give it a try. Also there was Material theme based existing template for the course. Installation was pretty straightforward from the package manager: sudo dnf install mkdocs-material . It will install both theme and documentation tool as a dependency. After that I manually copied course template files to my local working Git tree and tested it with command mkdocs serve . Worked, pretty simple. There was some challenges releasing that documentation on GitHub Pages. MkDocs documentation needs to be build in order to get site that can be released on GitHub Pages. It didn't feel very comfortable to commit machine build documentation to my working Git branch as it pollutes branch unintentionally without a reason. Fortunately there was a command mkdocs gh-deploy which makes new branch for documentation and publish it automatically. mkdocs serve mkdocs gh-deploy Serve launch local development site to your computer. gh-deploy builds site and uploads it to the GitHub Pages. Graph-Easy sudo dnf install perl-Graph-Easy Makes those simple diagrams used. echo \"[sensor 1], [sensor 2], [sensor N] -> [logic] <-> [radio] [power] -> [logic]\" | graph-easy --as_dot | dot -Tpng -o weather_station_graph.png Gives you graph:","title":"2.

Computer Aided design This week task was to study and evaluate different design tools - raster, vector, 2D and 3D. My personal needs are mostly 3D design so I did more testing and evaluation on that side. Selected design tools are: GIMP, Inkscape and FreeCAD. GIMP Basic picture editing tool selected was simply GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). I have used it earlier, it comes with Linux distribution used and it does the job. I think I don't even need it much during these courses. sudo dnf install gimp Inkscape Inkscape is a vector graphics editor I selected. It was natural choice as it was available from my OS package manager and it is rather feature rich. I am not sure how much I will need that kind of 2D vector graphic design tool still - probably for the laser cutter at least. As a test, I quickly draw simple half wave dipole antenna around 1000 MHz (not simulated not even calculated accurate, just a concept). I wonder if it is possible to laser cut that kind of small antennas from few millimeter thick aluminum plate... sudo dnf install inkscape dipole antenna.svg FreeCAD 3D design tool is one I likely need most. Here I evaluated Fusion 360 and FreeCAD. I had too much problems with Fusion 360. Firstly, Fusion 360 does not have Linux version and secondly that mess about user account. I tried it with Wine (Windows API implementation for Linux) but not very great results. It worked somehow, but feeling was a bit buggy. Also registration for Autodesk in order to get license was a bit tricky and you have to send some proofs (like picture of student id) in order to get education license. And for some reason it still started 30 days trial version of Fusion 360 even \"You\u2019re eligible for free one-year educational access to Autodesk products through the Autodesk Education Community.\". So I eventually switched to FreeCAD. My only earlier experience of 3D modeling I had was some experience modelling antennas using CST Studio. FreeCAD feels totally different which means learning curve will be rather heavy. After looking some tutorials from YouTube I was finally able to made simple design. It wasn't any part for my final project, but something useful still - it is cover plate for light switch. I need that as I have replaced manual light switches with smart ones that are controlled via home automation. 3D design made was build from 4 different blocks. All blocks were first drawn as 2D sketch and then converted to 3D model. First block was \"Pad\" which covers outlines of whole part. Then rest of three blocks were \"Pocket\" which are then removed from the Pad by boolean style operation. sudo dnf install freecad ABB Cover frame Jussi Impressivo.FCStd ABB Cover frame Jussi Impressivo.stl","title":"3.

Computer controlled cutting Weekly task This week went training with vinyl cutter and laser cutter and related design software. We started studying vinyl cutter basics and after that did same for the laser cutter. Most of the time went still learning laser cutting as that process is more complex starting from the 3D-modelling process. Vinyl cutting Vinyl cutter is printer look-a-like machine that has small knife in order to cut rather thin and soft material. Typically that material is just vinyl tape which is cut to some stickers. Used vinyl cutter was Roland CAMM-1 GS-24 and it was controlled by Windows workstation. Usually cutter is connected to computer like a printer using printer driver made for the device. So instead of printing, it will cut. Printed document needs to be converted some vector format. Line width didn't seems to have any requirement at our test, it just cuts where the line center line was. Anyhow, printer driver API is for printers and does not fit 100% well other use cases like that, so be warned there may be device vendor specific tricks which are varying from manufacturer to other and so. As a vinyl cutting exercise I made some Pokemon Go Team Valor logo stickers. I downloaded suitable existing logo which was a red colored raster image on transparent background in .png format. Then I used Inkscape Trace Bitmap tool to \"cut\" border of from that logo in order to get vector image from logo borders. That vector image was then cut using vinyl cutter. Here is image of used Valor logo Laser cutting Kerf Kerf is term for \"extra\" material removed by the cutting process itself. On ideal case cutting process does nothing but cuts your material as desired, but on real life there is very often mechanical or some other process that removes material. That is for example saw blade or laser beam. So if your saw blade is 1mm wide it will remove that much material and it is said that 1mm kerf is removed. Same applies for laser beam too as it burns material during cutting process. Kerf should be taken into account when that small amounts of extra removed material is essential. Kerf test for Acrylic 3mm I ran test for 3mm Acrylic plate. I got two different results depending how I ordered those 10 small pieces. Laser beam cut/kerf is not constant - it is wider on top side and a little bit smaller on bottom side. Larger calculated kerf is got when every other piece is upside-down and it is about double of size compared to another. Larger kerf value, 0.136mm, seems to be more realistic in real life on that case - think why and how it does. >> (100-99.45)/10 ans = 0.055000 >> (100-98.64)/10 ans = 0.13600 3D model of simple block I used FreeCAD to design simple brick having 4 joints, one for each side. Design is about simplest possible one. First I made 2D sketch and added constraints everywhere where possible. Spreadsheet is created basically just for the kerf parameter. It may be a bit overkill for this small design but parametric design principles were required so here it is in all flavors. It was somehow difficult to export sketch or 3D model outlines as vector format needed for laser cutter. On ideal case you just need to save/export it some format and that's all - but it is far from that. The way I did it was I made FreeCAD TehcnicalDrawing from part and exported it as a .svg. After that you can edit it on Inkscape, change line width to 0.02mm required by laser and so... I still wonder if there really is better tool chain to do all these tasks a bit more automatically. Download that block FreeCAD design Laser cutting Laser used was Epilog Fusion M2 40. 3D model from FreeCAD was imported to laser using following steps: Export FreeCAD Technical Drawing to vector format .svg Import .svg to Inkscape Edit line width to 0.02mm and check outlines Save as .pdf Open .pdf on laser workstation Select printer and edit printer settings Load correct laser settings per material used Send printer work to laser On laser; load material, power, air, etc. JOG. It is staring point of your laser print - upper left corner of document you sent to laser. There is red laser pointer showing exact point, use joystick to adjust. FOCUS. It is distance between laser beam and material. Mechanical triangle tool is for that. Use joystick to adjust, moves bed up/down. JOB. That's is printing document queue received by the laser machine. Select your job - it is likely the last one. GO. Start cutting. Wait minute or so after laser is finished before opening the lid. That's in order to get all burning products like dangerous smoke to get removed from the machine. Unfortunately there is very many things you can do wrong. It must be very careful with safety issues when working with laser cutter. Always do the basic checks mentioned on many places near laser (air intake, air outlet) and check the material compatibility.","title":"4.
