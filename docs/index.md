# About Me

Hello. I am Antti, CSE student from University of Oulu.

This is my student blog for the Fab Lab Oulu Course.

My main motivation to take that course was to learn how to design and implement mechanical parts using modern tools like 3D-printers and laser cutters.

I am interested of many kind electronics, especially embedded devices. One particular thing that has had on my mind long time is antenna array of 8 phased half-wave dipoles. Possible implementation methods could be PCB antenna or aluminum laser(?) cutted antenna thus I need to learn some needed tools.
