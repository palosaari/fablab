# About me

Hello. I am Antti, CSE student from University of Oulu.

My main motivation to take that course was to learn how to design and implement mechanical parts using modern tools like 3D-printers and laser cutters

I am interested of many kind electronics, especially embedded devices. One particular thing that has had on my mind long time is antenna array of 8 phased half-wave dipoles. Possible implementation methods could be PCB antenna or aluminum laser(?) cutted antenna thus I need to learn some needed tools.
