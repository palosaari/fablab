## Group project documentation 

I did this work with Aleksi, but we both have our own documentation. You can choose whether you want to read Aleksi's documentation, my documentation or both. Both should contain the same things with small differences. 

- Antti's Documentation 
    - [18 A. Mechanical Design (part 1 of 2)](../week18/)
    - [18 B. Mechanical Design (part 1 of 2) - group project ](../week18_groupwork/)
    - [19 A. Machine Design (part 2 of 2)](../week19/)
    - [19 B. Machine Design (part 2 of 2) - group project ](../week19_groupwork/)

## Pen Plotter functionality 

I don’t understand why this exercise is divided into two exercise tasks, Mechanical Design and Machine Design. In this part, which deals with the functionality of the device, I didn’t really have any individual work, or well - it has only been self-study of the techniques used. 

## Final thoughts 

This week I learned quite a bit of new stuff about the operation of stepper motors and especially how to control them. The topic is quite interesting and I would like to make my own CNC wood milling machine. Maybe I should change the current final project to design and manufacture a CNC milling machine.
